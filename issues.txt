This is a list of things we need to / have done to the website. We're going to look at the UI design guidelines and any other relevant lectures. For example, we should choose a color palette that works for color-blind people.

1) Installed Bootstrap (makes the website mobile responsive)
2) Followed Bootstrap's guidelines (their examples talk about accessibility--aria labels)
3) Use jQuery to handle cross-browser compatability issues.


One thing we might want to do is have the side bar disappear or appear below completely on smaller screens. (simple class change once everything is ported to use Bootstrap)

issues:

image slider looks weird on smaller screens. Perhaps we should just hide it on smaller devices?

1) Better colors
